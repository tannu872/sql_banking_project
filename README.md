# Comprehensive Banking Data Analysis with Advance SQL

## Project Overview

**Level**: Intermediate

**Database**: `bankingSqlProj1`

This project involves analyzing a multifaceted banking dataset, including tables on loans, customers, deposits, branches, and HR data. The goal was to extract insights through SQL queries that simulate real-world banking analytics. Key aspects include calculating loan totals, identifying customer profiles, analyzing branch performance, and generating insights on deposits and collections.

## Objectives

1. **Data Retrieval**: Querying customer and loan information to assess customer creditworthiness and loan distribution.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Summing deposits, averaging loan amounts, and analyzing collection data.
3. **Data Joining**: Linking tables to derive insights acrosss departments (e.g., associating branches with employees and customers).
4. **Data Manipulation**: Practiced INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, simulating the management of banking records.
5. **Advanced SQL**: Using subqueries, window functions, and complex joins to uncover detailed insights like average balances and branch rankings.
